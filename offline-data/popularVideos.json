          "description": "https://stjude.org/donate/donate-to-st-jude.html\nhttps://curesarcoma.org/donate/\nhttps://giving.mskcc.org\n\n\nI didn't remember much on how I grew to love his content, but I remember knowing him through my brother. A few days before the Mr. Beast duel, I remember him asking me who would win. Me knowing Dream more than Techno, I had chosen the former, and my brother the latter. After that, I watched Techno's analysis of the duel, and his methods of telling a story in a witty humorous way is what captivated me and it just spiraled from there.\n\nI grew to love him even more during his grand entrance in the Dream SMP, and it just continued as he became one of the major characters in it and had impact the lore so greatly. I was so excited to draw him in my next animatic: 'The Fall', because I liked drawing him in the 'Techno vs Dream' animation, and more importantly, I can also continue the lore of Techno's hair design haha.\n\nOn November 16, after a huge lore stream, I tweeted out if any of the Dream SMP members could message me if they have any available clear audio that I can use. The only person who ever approached me was Technoblade, and was so considerate to make a separated recording of the entire stream which was so awesome!! Especially that so many people was just talking over his epic speech. What I find funny is that despite the recording having no game audio, and other people talking, I could hear the classic clicking of his keyboard that might have been louder than him in some moments.\n\nOn that same month, he became one of my patrons and I remember just fangirling so much. I didn't know how to thank him because I was still very anxious about messaging larger creators, thought my way of appreciating someone is through gestures. And so 'Hog Hunt' was made, which was pretty centric towards his character that he plays. I tried to be not as biased and give most of the members their moments, but this one's an exception haha.\n\nAfter that, I made a few MCYT animations and slowly fell out of the fandom, although I would rewatch some of his videos that I really liked, such as SBI related content, Potato War, and videos with Skeppy. I would look up in some of Techno fanarts because they had the most creative designs of his character and I'd love each and every one of them.\n\nDespite me slowly moving out of the fandom, he still continued to support me through patron. I did felt bad because of it, especially that he was going through a tough moment at that time. He did stopped, and it kind of felt weird that I was relieved. But I believed he needed it more than I do. That was the time I finally decided to send him a proper thank you message for everything he did. Not only did he supported me, but the rest of my family and my relatives.\n\nThat was a few weeks after the unfortunate news, I was having a break out of the internet loop, and so I had to hear it from my brother. I was in denial for 3 days and heck even now. I felt so regretful that I might not have thanked him soon enough. And yet I can't help myself but admire how despite what he had been through, he remained the cool, witty and funny person that he had always been even to the end. And the impact he left with everyone is now louder than ever. He had helped so many of his audience even if those actions can't be seen by many, he still helped so much anyways.\n\nSo with all that, let me say this again:\n\nTechnoblade, Thank you so so much. For the laughs. For the wits. For the skill. For the content. For the inspiration. For the community. For the friends we made. For the kindness. For everything.\n\nIf he ever read this, I bet he'd cringe. Good.\n\nFarewell. Live on.",
